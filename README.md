| ðŸ§  [Cairo AI](https://github.com/Cairo-Creative-Studios/Cairo-AI)     | I love pushing the boundaries of AI in games. Currently, I'm working on creating experimental AI models that bring new levels of intelligence and interactivity to virtual worlds. These AI Models are implemented using the UDT, for the sake of simplicity and are most likely the shortest path to AI development. (note that I didn't say the best)   |
